# Grapher

Grapher is a utility built in JavaScript for drawing graphs (the vertices/edges kind). I couldn't find a way of easily
making vectorized graphs in LaTeX, so this hopefully makes it somewhat easier for typesetting homework, writing papers, etc.

## Installation

To use Grapher, simply place ``index.html`` and ``grapher.js`` in the same directory. ``index.html`` is a very simple webpage that contains an 800 x 800 canvas and PNG/LaTeX export buttons.
