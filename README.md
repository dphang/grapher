# Grapher

Grapher is a utility built in JavaScript for drawing graphs (the vertices/edges kind). I couldn't find a way of easily
making vectorized graphs in LaTeX, so this hopefully makes it somewhat easier. I know it helped me because I'm a big fan
of typesetting homework, especially for computer science classes.
