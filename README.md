# Grapher

Grapher is a small utility built in JavaScript for drawing graphs (the vertices/edges kind). I couldn't find a way of easily
making vectorized graphs in LaTeX, so this hopefully makes it easier to include simple graphs in homework, papers, etc.

## Installation

To use Grapher, simply clone this repository into any directory. `index.html` is a very simple webpage that demonstrates how Grapher may be used.

## License

Grapher is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
